# Standardized Folder Structure: A Cornerstone for the Future of Software Development

## Abstract

This white paper introduces a **universal folder structure** for organizing code in software projects, emphasizing **modularity**, **separation of concerns**, and **scalability**. It addresses common challenges such as **technical debt**, **inconsistent architecture**, and the need for a paradigm shift away from **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. While OOP was initially developed to promote modularity and reuse, it often leads to over-architecting and rigid class hierarchies, complicating long-term maintenance. By adopting this universal folder structure, development teams can work toward achieving **"same code"**—a consistent and predictable codebase used across all developers—thereby reducing technical debt and improving scalability across diverse platforms and frameworks. The **procedural nature** of this structure simplifies development by reducing the complexity introduced by OOP, leading to **more accurate development estimations** and streamlined workflows.

Just as a well-laid foundation ensures the stability of a building, this universal folder structure provides a solid base upon which scalable and maintainable code can be built, enabling long-term success in software development and future standardizations.

## 1. Introduction

Software engineering, unlike other traditional engineering disciplines, lacks a widely accepted, formalized blueprint for organizing code. While fields such as civil and mechanical engineering rely on well-established standards and blueprints, software engineering is more decentralized and fragmented in its approach. This decentralization results in a lack of cohesive practices for organizing and structuring code, making it difficult to maintain long-term solutions as projects scale [1], [2].

In many ways, software today allows for significant creativity, which can sometimes lead to inefficiencies if not properly structured. Much like building furniture that serves its purpose but suffers from structural flaws, software can be written in a way that technically functions but gradually accumulates **technical debt**. When developers write non-standard or overly complex code, it can lead to systems that function but are increasingly difficult to maintain as complexity builds over time.

As software projects grow in complexity, teams face increased technical debt, scalability issues, and inconsistent architectures. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, once heralded for promoting modularity and encapsulation, often results in **over-architecting**, where deeply nested class hierarchies and excessive inheritance create rigid, hard-to-refactor systems. These problems are compounded by the absence of a universally accepted project structure, leading to inconsistent architectures and difficulties in maintaining and scaling systems [3], [1], [4].

However, if we consider **well-crafted code** as code that adheres to standardized practices at the **high-level**, **intermediate-level**, and **instruction-level**, we can establish a framework that developers can follow. In this model, the **intermediate-level** corresponds to the **single responsibilities** of features, while the rest of the code falls into place naturally through a consistent structure. By enforcing one unified strategy based on a universal folder structure and **procedural code**, developers can avoid accumulating technical debt. This approach ensures **clear implementation layers**, with distinct **single responsibilities** for groups of instructions.

When a developer identifies that a portion of code handles more than one responsibility, they can simply create a new folder and split the code into two additional files, promoting **modularity** and **scalability**. This procedural approach, akin to other engineering disciplines, reduces tech debt and enhances long-term maintainability.

This paper advocates for the adoption of a practical, scalable folder structure that can be applied across various software development environments and paradigms, offering a more flexible and maintainable alternative to traditional OOP practices.

## 2. The Problem with Current Practices

### 2.1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Over-Architecture
OOP was initially developed to solve problems related to **modularity**, **encapsulation**, and **reusability**, but its over-reliance on deep hierarchies and inheritance often introduces more complexity than it resolves. This results in:
- **Over-architecting**: OOP encourages the creation of complex, rigid class hierarchies that are difficult to refactor.
- **Tech Debt**: Tightly coupled systems accrue tech debt over time as small changes in base classes ripple through entire systems.
- **Misuse of Inheritance**: In large teams, inheritance often leads to unintended dependencies and difficulty managing shared components.

### 2.2 Framework Dependency and Fragmentation
Many modern projects are also **over-reliant on specific frameworks**, which leads to fragmented codebases. Frameworks such as **Express.js**, **React**, and others often serve as both the framework and the business logic processor, leading to entangled code that is hard to separate. Decoupling framework logic from core business logic is essential to maintaining long-term flexibility.

## 3. The Universal Folder Structure: A Scalable, Framework-Agnostic Solution

This **universal folder structure** proposes a feature-based approach that separates concerns into **layers of abstraction** that are implicitly defined by the depth of the folder hierarchy. The further down in the tree structure, the more **low-level** the instructions are, while **higher-level operations** remain closer to the root.

### Key Elements of the Structure:

1. **Feature-Based Organization**: Each feature in the system has its own directory, encapsulating its functionality.
2. **Implicit Abstraction Layers**: The depth of the file tree defines the abstraction level—**low-level instructions** live deeper in the tree, while **high-level orchestration** lives closer to the root.
3. **Framework Decoupling**: Framework-specific logic, such as routing and response handling, exists **outside the feature folder**, keeping the core business logic clean and modular.

### Example Folder Structure (Adapted to Your Structure):
```
src
  http-server
    features
      server
        connection_handler
          connection_handler_macro.o
          connection_handler.o
          messages.o
        error_handler
          error_handler.o
          messages.o
        protocols
          base_protocol.o
          http_protocol.o
          websocket_protocol.o
        shared
          constants.o
        socket
          shared
            constants.o
          setup_socket_macro.o
          setup_socket.o
        server_macro.o
        server.o
      shared
        macros.o
      main.o
  studio
    features
      shared
        field
          field.s
        primitive_field
          primitive_field.s
      canvas
        canvas.s
      fields
        text_field
          text_field.s
        column_field.s
        section_field.s
  main
    main.s
```

In this structure:
* Main Features (e.g., /server/) contain multiple sub-components like connection handling, error handling, and protocol management, organized into their respective folders.
* Low-Level Instructions like connection_handler.o, setup_socket.o, and messages.o exist deeper in the tree and handle specific, low-level tasks.
* Shared resources (e.g., constants and macros) are placed in a /shared/ directory, accessible across different features without duplicating logic.

## 4. Applying the Structure Across Different Features
This structure is flexible enough to be applied to various types of features across backend, frontend, and full-stack projects, maintaining clear separation between logic layers.

### 4.1 Backend Feature: User Authentication
User authentication in a backend system can be organized with clearly defined layers of abstraction, from the feature level down to low-level operations like interacting with databases or hashing passwords.
Example:
```
src/http-server
 features
  auth
    connection_handler
      connection_handler.o
      messages.o
    protocols
      auth_protocol.o
    auth_macro.o
    auth.o
```

- **High-level file (`auth.o`)** orchestrates the overall login flow.
- **Intermediate files (`auth_protocol.o`)** handle the protocols needed for authentication.
- **Low-level instructions (`connection_handler.o`)** validate credentials and interact with the database.

### 4.2 Frontend Feature: Shopping Cart

On the frontend, this structure handles **state management**, **DOM manipulation**, and **API interactions** while keeping the business logic decoupled from UI rendering.

**Example:**
```
/src/frontend
  /features
    /cart
      /handlers
        add_item_handler.o
      /state_management
        cart_state.o
      /shared
        constants.o
      cart.o
```

### 4.3 Full-Stack Feature: File Upload and Processing
A file upload feature can span both frontend and backend, following this structure for clarity and maintainability.

Example:
```
/src/features/file-upload
  /handlers
    file_upload_handler.o
  /shared
    constants.o
  file_upload.o
```

## 5. Framework Integration: Decoupling Logic from Frameworks

Frameworks like **Express.js**, **React**, and others play an essential role in handling system processes but should remain **external to the core business logic**. In this folder structure, frameworks are treated as **triggers** for processes rather than the driving force behind business logic [2]. This decoupling ensures that any framework can be replaced or updated without modifying the business logic.

**Example in Express.js**:
```
/src/http-server
  /routes
    /auth_routes.o   (Express route handlers that trigger auth feature)
  /features
    /auth
      /auth.o        (entry point for authentication logic)
```

The routes folder handles framework-specific interactions (e.g., extracting req and res in Express), while the core feature logic remains clean and modular inside the /features/ directory. This decoupling ensures that the project structure remains scalable and adaptable in the long term [1], [2].

## 6. Case Studies and Real-World Applications
Several companies have successfully adopted similar modular structures:
* Microsoft: Modular architectures have allowed teams to iterate on large-scale projects without creating significant tech debt.
* Airbnb: By separating business logic from platform-specific code, Airbnb has improved maintainability and scalability across their product suite.
* Google: Google’s microservice architecture benefits from clear separation of concerns, enabling teams to work independently on different services.

## 7. Standardization and Future Steps
To formalize this structure, we propose the following roadmap:
1. Industry Collaboration: Engage software architects, developers, and educators in refining this standard.
2. Tooling: Create scaffolding tools (CLI utilities, IDE plugins) to help developers adopt this structure easily.
3. Academic Integration: Work with universities and bootcamps to incorporate this structure into curriculum, ensuring the next generation of developers is trained on modular, scalable architectures.
4. Enterprise Adoption: Partner with companies to adopt this structure, demonstrating its benefits in real-world, large-scale applications.

## 8. Conclusion
The universal folder structure presented here represents a new standard for organizing software projects, promoting modularity, scalability, and long-term maintainability. By separating concerns into layers of abstraction based on folder depth, it provides a robust foundation for future software development, capable of reducing tech debt and simplifying the development process [1], [2].
