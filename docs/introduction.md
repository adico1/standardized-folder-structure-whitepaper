# Introduction to CORE

## Overview

**CORE** is a comprehensive, standardized framework for modern software development that promotes **modularity, encapsulation, and consistency** across the codebase. It aims to set a clear standard for how software should be organized, written, and maintained, providing a unified approach that enhances readability, testability, and scalability.

CORE is built on two foundational components:

1. **EMF (Encapsulated Modular Framework)**: A structural guideline for organizing software into **self-contained, encapsulated modules** with well-defined dependencies and boundaries.
2. **TSW (The Standard Way)**: A set of best practices for coding with clarity and consistency, focusing on **function readability, abstraction, and standardization** across the codebase.

Together, **EMF** and **TSW** provide a comprehensive framework that can be applied to various types of software projects, from small codebases to large-scale, distributed systems.

## CORE's Vision and Purpose

### Vision
CORE envisions a standardized approach to software engineering where code structure and writing practices are unified to create **scalable, maintainable, and high-quality software**. By defining clear principles and guidelines, CORE serves as a guiding framework that enables developers to collaborate, expand, and improve codebases efficiently and consistently.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of CORE is to establish a **framework that drives uniformity, readability, and quality** in software projects. By combining structural guidelines with coding best practices, CORE provides teams with:

- A **scalable architecture** that supports both growth and change.
- Clear, accessible code that can be easily understood and modified.
- A framework that reduces technical debt and promotes long-term maintainability.

## Benefits of Adopting CORE Principles

### 1. Enhanced Modularity and Encapsulation
   - CORE’s modular structure, defined by **EMF**, enables each feature or functionality to exist as an **independent module** with clear boundaries and encapsulated logic. This modularity ensures that components are self-contained and reusable.
   - Encapsulation at the module level keeps internal logic hidden from other modules, reducing the risk of unintended dependencies or conflicts.

   **Example**: A `UserProfile` feature in a web application could be built as a self-contained module, encapsulating all its logic, configuration, and resources. By exposing only necessary functions through a public interface, other modules can access `UserProfile`'s functionality without knowing its internal workings.

### 2. Single-Directional Dependencies and Scalability
   - By enforcing **single-direction dependencies** and preventing circular dependencies, CORE maintains a clear, hierarchical structure that supports scaling. High-level modules depend only on lower-level modules, creating an organized flow that makes it easy to add, replace, or refactor code without disrupting the system.

   **Example**: A module responsible for `DataProcessing` may depend on a lower-level `DataFetcher` module but should not depend on any module that relies on it, such as `ReportGenerator`. This structure minimizes dependency complexity and makes large codebases more manageable.

### 3. Consistent, Readable, and Maintainable Code
   - **TSW** promotes best practices in coding that make code **easy to read and understand**. By following principles of abstraction, function clarity, and standardized naming, CORE ensures that code across the project remains consistent and accessible, even as the project grows.
   - **Function purity** and marking **stateful and async functions** further clarify the role of each function, aiding readability and debugging.

   **Example**: Following TSW principles, a function that calculates a user’s order total could be named `calculateOrderTotal`, with a clear and descriptive name, while also ensuring that lower-level details (e.g., tax calculation) are abstracted into helper functions like `calculateTax`.

### 4. Isolated and Thorough Testing
   - CORE encourages testing both public and private functions at the module level, providing **complete test coverage** without relying solely on the public interface. This approach allows developers to test the internal logic and functionality of each module, supporting isolated and robust testing practices.

   **Example**: In a `Payments` module, both the main function `processPayment` and any helper functions it uses can be tested independently. This allows for unit tests that verify internal behavior and edge cases without requiring the module’s public interface.

### 5. Flexible Configuration Management
   - By separating **build configurations** (managed at the root level) from **application configurations** (organized under `src/main`), CORE keeps configuration settings organized and adaptable. Each module or feature encapsulates its own configuration where appropriate, supporting multiple environments and reducing the risk of configuration conflicts.

   **Example**: The application’s main configuration in `src/main` might define global settings (e.g., API endpoints, logging levels), while each feature can manage its own settings (e.g., a `Cache` feature with a `cacheConfig` file) in an encapsulated manner.

## CORE’s Key Principles and Values

### Modularity and Encapsulation
   - CORE’s modular structure ensures that each feature or functionality is **encapsulated and independent**. Modules are structured to have minimal dependencies on other parts of the system, and they expose only the necessary parts through a public interface.

### Clear Boundaries and Interfaces
   - With clear public and private interfaces, CORE defines what is exposed to other modules, minimizing coupling and creating a system that’s **easy to understand and extend**. Each module can be viewed as a “black box,” with well-defined inputs and outputs.

### Standardization and Readability
   - By following **The Standard Way (TSW)**, developers maintain **uniformity and clarity** across the codebase. Naming conventions, function purity, and code style are standardized to create a cohesive codebase that’s easy for both new and experienced developers to navigate.

### Testability and Quality Assurance
   - Testing in CORE goes beyond black-box testing. Developers are encouraged to write tests for private functions, ensuring that both internal and external logic is reliable and fully tested. This approach reduces bugs and improves overall code quality.

## Conclusion

CORE offers a unified framework for building modular, readable, and scalable software. By combining the structural principles of **EMF** with the coding best practices of **TSW**, CORE provides a complete approach to software design, establishing industry-wide standards for clarity, consistency, and quality in codebases of all sizes.

To get started with CORE, review the [EMF guidelines](EMF_guidelines.md) and [TSW guidelines](TSW_guidelines.md) for step-by-step instructions on how to apply these principles in your project.
