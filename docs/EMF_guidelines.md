Purpose: Define Encapsulated Modular Framework (EMF), including its structure, rules, and guidelines.
Content Outline:
Overview of EMF principles (e.g., modularity, single-direction dependencies, encapsulation).
Guidelines on public/private interface control, function purity, prefixing stateful and async functions, and avoiding circular dependencies.
Instructions for configuration management: root level for build configs, src/main for application config.
A step-by-step example of structuring a module according to EMF principles.
