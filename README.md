# CORE: Comprehensive, Organized Repository for Engineering

Welcome to **CORE**â€”a **gold standard** for organizing code across languages, frameworks, and architectures. CORE simplifies your project with a **Dependency-Driven Folder Structure (DDFS)**, focusing on clarity, scalability, and flexibility, making it ideal for **monorepos**, **microservices**, and **large-scale projects**. COREâ€™s adaptable, modular design ensures seamless integration across languages and platforms.

## Why CORE? ðŸš€

CORE isnâ€™t just a folder structure; itâ€™s a comprehensive, modular architecture that brings clarity, predictability, and scalability to your projects. Hereâ€™s a quick look at what CORE offers:

- **Language Agnostic**: Adapts to any language and framework, ideal for cross-platform teams.
- **Predictable and Scalable**: Each module is structured for growth, simplifying team collaboration and project scaling.
- **Clear and Intuitive Navigation**: Organizes code by dependencies and purpose, so everyone finds what they need faster.
- **Compatible with Frameworks**: CORE works across microservices, monoliths, and mono-repos, maintaining order as your project grows.

> CORE is more than just a folder structureâ€”itâ€™s a system that drives simplicity, clarity, and efficiency.

## Quick Overview of CORE Structure

CORE organizes code into clear layers, following **DDFS** (Dependency-Driven Folder Structure) principles. DDFS emphasizes a hierarchy where:
   - **Orchestrators** handle top-level flow and dependencies.
   - **Components** manage feature-specific tasks and services.
   - **Dependencies** handle reusable functionality across features.

Hereâ€™s a look at the CORE layout with **features/** as the primary organizational point.

    A[Project Root] --> B[src]
    A --> C[config]
    A --> D[tests]
    A --> E[deploy]
    B --> F[features]
    F --> F1[feature1]
    F1 --> F1a[orchestrators]
    F1 --> F1b[components]
    F1 --> F1c[dependencies]
    B --> G[main]
    B --> H[common]
```

## CORE in Action: Key Advantages

1. **Consistency Across Teams**: Each feature follows the same layout, making it easy to onboard new team members and maintain clarity in large codebases.
2. **Enhanced Modularity**: Independent feature folders allow teams to work in parallel, reducing code conflicts and increasing flexibility.
3. **Structured Flow from Design to Implementation**: Orchestrators and components ensure that design translates seamlessly into code, improving project alignment and reliability.

## Getting Started with CORE

Follow these steps to get the most out of CORE:

### Step 1: Understand the Basics

Each folder in CORE has a distinct role:

- **src/**: Core source code, split by `features/`, `main/`, and `common/`.
- **config/**: Configurations for different environments like development and production.
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests, each aligned with `src/` modules.
- **deploy/**: Deployment files (Docker, Kubernetes, scripts) for easy CI/CD setup.

### Step 2: Explore Example Projects

Visit the `examples/` folder to see COREâ€™s modular approach in action across languages and frameworks.

### Step 3: Dive Deeper with Documentation

   - **[Quick-Start Guide](./quick-start-guide.md)**: Essential steps to set up CORE in your projects.
   - **[Migration Guide](./migration-guide.md)**: Transition existing projects to CORE seamlessly.
   - **[White Paper](./white-paper.md)**: Detailed insights into COREâ€™s architecture and practical benefits.

## CORE Folder Breakdown

The **features/** folder is the CORE of your project, organized by purpose and dependency:

1. **Orchestrators**: High-level modules coordinating feature workflows.
2. **Components**: Independent functional units handling specific tasks.
3. **Dependencies**: Reusable low-level functions, shared across modules.

Other essential folders include:
- **config/**: Config files by environment (e.g., dev, prod), making environment shifts seamless.
- **tests/**: Structured testing files to ensure robust and reliable builds.
- **deploy/**: CI/CD-ready scripts and configuration files (Docker, Kubernetes).

## Real-World Transformation with CORE

### Before and After: From Monolithic to Modular

**Before CORE (Monolithic Structure)**:
```plaintext
project-root/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js
â”œâ”€â”€ config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”œâ”€â”€ views/
â””â”€â”€ tests/
```

**After CORE (DDFS Structure)**:
```plaintext
project-root/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ features/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feature1/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ orchestrators/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dependencies/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ common/
â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â””â”€â”€ deploy/
```

**Benefits**:
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Each feature is self-contained, with a clear dependency path for updates.
- **Scalability**: Isolated feature modules make the project adaptable and scalable.

## CI/CD with CORE

Below is a sample GitHub Actions workflow showcasing COREâ€™s CI/CD integration for seamless automation.

```yaml
# GitHub Actions Workflow
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test --prefix tests/
```
