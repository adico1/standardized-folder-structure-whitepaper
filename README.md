# Standardized Folder Structure for Scalable Software Development

This repository contains the whitepaper and examples for a proposed standardized folder structure aimed at enhancing scalability, maintainability, and readability in software projects. The proposed structure is designed for enterprise-level and complex software systems with a long-term vision.

## Overview

The whitepaper outlines a novel approach to organizing software projects, blending principles from Clean Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture with a practical, feature-oriented structure. It focuses on modularity, separation of concerns, and AI-readiness.

## Introduction

The software development industry often faces challenges with inconsistent folder structures that can hinder scalability and maintainability. This whitepaper presents a solution that addresses these challenges through a standardized folder structure, targeting projects that require long-term growth and collaboration.

## Proposed Folder Structure

The proposed folder structure is organized as follows:
