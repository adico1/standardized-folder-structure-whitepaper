# CORE: Comprehensive, Organized Repository for Engineering

Welcome to **CORE**, an optimized structure designed to advance software engineering through **dependency-driven modularity**, enhanced organization, and streamlined scalability. CORE embodies the philosophy of *The Standard Way* or the *Dao of Software Engineering*, which emphasizes clarity, consistency, and predictability in development processes.

## 📜 Overview of the Repository

This repository serves as both a practical guide and reference architecture for **CORE**. It provides a **Dependency-Driven Folder Structure (DDFS)**, also referred to as the **Standardized Modular Folder Structure (SMFS)**, designed to ensure predictability, maintainability, and scalability in software projects.

Key concepts include:
- **CORE Architecture**: A comprehensive, modular project structure for organized development.
- **The Standard Way (Dao of Software Engineering)**: Fostering predictable, comparable, and estimable software outcomes.
- **DDFS / SMFS**: A forward-thinking, dependency-driven structure, positioned as a cornerstone for scalable software development.

### Folder Hierarchy Flowchart

Below is the CORE architecture’s folder hierarchy, providing a visual guide to the modular layout. The dependency-driven structure promotes clear boundaries, scalable feature management, and optimized collaboration.

\\```

### Folder Explanations

Each folder in CORE has a specific purpose, designed to simplify development and maintenance.

- **src/**: Core source code, organized by:
  - `main/`: Entry points and primary controllers.
  - `features/`: Each feature in a dedicated module (e.g., `feature1/`, `feature2/`) to support isolated development.
  - `common/`: Shared utilities or components across features.
- **config/**: Environment-specific configurations:
  - `development/`: Configurations for local and dev environments.
  - `production/`: Configurations for production environments.
- **tests/**: Testing resources, including:
  - `unit tests/`: Focused tests for specific functions.
  - `integration tests/`: Tests that verify interactions between multiple modules.
- **deploy/**: Deployment assets and configurations:
  - `docker/`: Docker configurations for containerized deployments.
  - `kubernetes/`: Kubernetes configurations for orchestrated deployments.
  - `deployment scripts/`: Scripts to automate deployment pipelines.

## 🌟 CORE Principles and Benefits

### 1. **The Standard Way (Dao of Software Engineering)**: Predictable, Comparable, Estimable

*Following “The Way” (道) in software, CORE fosters structure that is:*
   - **Predictable**: Each module has a defined purpose, reducing ambiguity.
   - **Comparable**: Uniform folder structure enables easy comparisons across projects.
   - **Estimable**: Clear boundaries and responsibilities allow for more accurate estimations of time and costs.

### 2. **DDFS (Dependency-Driven Folder Structure)**: Foundation for the Future

*DDFS organizes projects by dependencies, supporting modularity and clear feature boundaries. CORE’s DDFS aligns with CI/CD and encourages effective module-based collaboration, enhancing scalability for enterprise and large-team projects.*

### 3. **Modular Design for Team Flexibility**

*CORE’s structure isolates team areas, reducing merge conflicts and making it easier for new team members to onboard by following a well-defined, predictable structure.*

## 📂 Before-and-After Comparison

This section illustrates how CORE restructures a monolithic project. Below is a sample transformation of an initial monolithic layout to the standardized CORE format.

**Before** (Monolithic):
\\```plaintext
project-root/
├── app.js
├── config.js
├── controllers/
├── models/
├── views/
└── tests/
\\```

**After** (CORE Structure):
\\```plaintext
project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   ├── features/
│   └── common/
├── config/
├── tests/
└── deploy/
\\```

*Benefits of the CORE refactor include reduced complexity, modular separation, and easier scaling.*

## 🛠️ CI/CD Setup with CORE

Below is a GitHub Actions workflow that integrates testing within the CORE structure. This setup demonstrates how seamlessly CORE aligns with CI/CD processes.

\\```yaml
# GitHub Actions Workflow
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test --prefix tests/
\\```
