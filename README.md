# CORE: The Standardized Framework for Software Development

CORE is a comprehensive framework to standardize modular, encapsulated, and consistent software development. It is composed of two primary components:

- **EMF (Encapsulated Modular Framework)**: A structural guide for organizing code into modular, encapsulated units with clear interfaces and minimal dependencies.
- **The Standard Way (The DAO of Software Engineering)**: Best practices for writing clean, readable, and consistent code that aligns with the principles of EMF.

CORE provides developers with a clear path to building scalable, maintainable, and high-quality software through modular design and standardized coding practices.

## Getting Started

1. Read through the [introduction](docs/introduction.md) to understand COREâ€™s principles.
2. Follow [EMF guidelines](docs/EMF_guidelines.md) for structuring your project.
3. Adhere to [The Standard Way](docs/TSW_guidelines.md) for best coding practices.
