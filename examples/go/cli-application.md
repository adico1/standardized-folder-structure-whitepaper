This Go CLI application structure demonstrates:

1. **Shared Resources**: Common utilities, configurations, and base models in the `internal/shared/` directory.
2. **Feature-Centric Organization**: Separate directories for user commands and file operations features.
3. **Clear Separation**: Each feature has its own set of command implementations.
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features or expand existing ones without affecting others.
5. **Testability**: Separate directories for unit and integration tests.

Key aspects of this structure:

- **Command Pattern**: Main application entry point in `cmd/myapp/main.go`.
- **Internal Package**: Use of `internal/` for packages that shouldn't be imported by other projects.
- **Shared Utilities**: Common string and file utilities in `internal/shared/utils/`.
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration in `internal/shared/config/`.
- **Feature Isolation**: Each set of related commands (usercommands, fileoperations) is isolated in its own directory.
- **Public Package**: `pkg/` directory for packages that can be used by external projects.

This structure allows for easy maintenance and expansion of the CLI application, with clear separation of concerns and reusable components. It follows Go best practices and conventions while adhering to the principles of the standardized folder structure.
