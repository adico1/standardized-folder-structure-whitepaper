This Assembly low-level system module demonstrates:

1. **Shared Components (shrd)**:
   - `macros/`: Reusable assembly macros for I/O operations and mathematical calculations.
   - `constants/`: System-wide constants and definitions.
   - `utilities/`: Common utility functions for string manipulation and memory operations.

2. **Features**:
   - `shared/`: Common interrupt handlers used across different features.
   - `boot/`: Boot sector and bootloader implementation.
   - `kernel/`: Core kernel components including entry point, memory management, and process scheduling.
   - `drivers/`: Hardware-specific drivers for keyboard and display.
   - `filesystem/`: Basic filesystem operations and directory management.

3. **Main Entry Point**:
   - `system_main.asm`: The main entry point for the system after booting.

4. **Include**:
   - Hardware-specific definitions and constants.

5. **Tests**:
   - Unit tests for individual components.
   - Integration tests for system-wide processes.

6. **Tools**:
   - Scripts for assembling and emulating the system.

7. **Makefile**:
   - For building and managing the project.

Key aspects of the standardized approach applied to this assembly project:

- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Shared utilities, feature-specific code, and main entry point are clearly separated.
- **Feature-Centric Organization**: Each major system component (boot, kernel, drivers, filesystem) is organized as a feature.
- **Shared Resources**: Common macros, constants, and utilities are centralized in the `shared` directory.
- **Testability**: The structure supports both unit and integration testing.
- **Build and Development Tools**: Included in the project structure for easy development and deployment.

This structure adapts the principles from the whitepaper to the unique needs of an assembly language project, providing a clear and maintainable organization for low-level system development.
