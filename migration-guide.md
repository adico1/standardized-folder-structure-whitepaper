# Migration Guide: Transitioning to the Standardized Folder Structure

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to transition an existing project to our standardized folder structure. It includes best practices, potential pitfalls to avoid, and strategies for a smooth migration.

## Pre-Migration Steps

1. **Analyze Current Structure**:
   - Document your current folder structure and identify major components.
   - List all features/modules in your application.

2. **Plan the New Structure**:
   - Map out how your current components will fit into the new structure.
   - Identify shared resources that will move to the `shared/` directory.

3. **Create a Migration Strategy**:
   - Decide whether to migrate all at once or incrementally by feature.
   - Set a timeline and milestones for the migration.

4. **Prepare Your Team**:
   - Communicate the upcoming changes to all team members.
   - Provide training or documentation on the new structure.

5. **Set Up Version Control**:
   - Create a new branch for the migration.
   - Ensure you have a recent backup of your project.

## Migration Process

1. **Create New Structure**:
   ```
   mkdir -p src/{shared,features,main} tests/{unit,integration}
   ```

2. **Move Shared Resources**:
   - Identify and move common utilities, services, and models to `src/shared/`.
   - Update import statements in files that use these shared resources.

3. **Migrate Features**:
   - For each feature/module:
     a. Create a new directory under `src/features/`.
     b. Move relevant components, services, and models into this directory.
     c. Update import statements within the feature.

4. **Relocate Main Entry Point**:
   - Move your main application file to `src/main/`.
   - Update any necessary configurations to reflect this change.

5. **Restructure Tests**:
   - Move unit tests to `tests/unit/`, mirroring the `src/` structure.
   - Move integration tests to `tests/integration/`.

6. **Update Build Configuration**:
   - Modify your build scripts to work with the new structure.
   - Update any path aliases or module resolution settings.

7. **Update CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Adjust your CI/CD configuration to accommodate the new structure.

## Best Practices

- **Incremental Migration**: If possible, migrate one feature at a time to minimize disruption.
- **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, consistent naming conventions across all directories.
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct thorough code reviews during the migration to catch any issues early.
- **Testing**: Run your test suite frequently during migration to catch broken dependencies quickly.
- **Documentation**: Update your documentation to reflect the new structure as you migrate.

## Potential Pitfalls and Solutions

1. **Circular Dependencies**:
   - Pitfall: Creating circular imports between features or with shared resources.
   - Solution: Carefully plan your imports. Consider using dependency injection or restructuring if necessary.

2. **Overstuffed Shared Directory**:
   - Pitfall: Putting too much in the `shared/` directory, losing the benefits of feature isolation.
   - Solution: Regularly review the `shared/` directory. Only include truly common, reusable code.

3. **Inconsistent Structure Across Features**:
   - Pitfall: Each feature having a wildly different internal structure.
   - Solution: Establish and document conventions for feature directory structure.

4. **Breaking Changes in Shared Resources**:
   - Pitfall: Changes in shared resources breaking multiple features.
   - Solution: Practice careful version control and consider using interfaces for shared services.

5. **Loss of Git History**:
   - Pitfall: Losing file history when moving files.
   - Solution: Use `git mv` instead of regular move operations to preserve history.

## Post-Migration Steps

1. **Validation**:
   - Run all tests to ensure everything works as expected.
   - Perform manual testing of key functionalities.

2. **Performance Check**:
   - Compare application performance before and after migration.
   - Address any performance regressions.

3. **Team Feedback**:
   - Gather feedback from the team on the new structure.
   - Address any concerns or difficulties they're experiencing.

4. **Documentation Update**:
   - Ensure all documentation reflects the new structure.
   - Create or update contribution guidelines to maintain the new structure.

5. **Cleanup**:
   - Remove any redundant files or directories left from the old structure.
   - Optimize imports and remove unused dependencies.

By following this guide, you can smoothly transition your existing project to the new standardized folder structure, minimizing disruption and maximizing the benefits of the new organization.
