# Quick Start Guide: Implementing the Standardized Folder Structure

This guide provides a concise overview of the basic principles of our standardized folder structure and step-by-step instructions for implementing it in both new and existing projects.

## Basic Principles

1. **Feature-Centric Organization**: Code is primarily organized around features or business domains.
2. **Shared Resources**: Common code and utilities are kept in a dedicated `shared` directory.
3. **Clear Separation**: Clear boundaries between different features and shared resources.
4. **Scalability**: Structure designed to accommodate project growth and team expansion.
5. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent organization across different architectural styles.

## Folder Structure Overview

```
project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── shared/ (shrd)
│   │   ├── utils/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── models/
│   ├── features/
│   │   ├── feature1/
│   │   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   ├── services/
│   │   │   └── models/
│   │   └── feature2/
│   │       ├── components/
│   │       ├── services/
│   │       └── models/
│   └── main/
│       └── app-entry-point
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/
│   └── integration/
└── package.json (or equivalent)
```

## Implementation Steps for a New Project

1. Create the root project directory.
2. Set up the basic folder structure:
   ```
   mkdir -p src/{shared,features,main} tests/{unit,integration}
   ```
3. Initialize your project (e.g., `npm init` for Node.js projects).
4. Create subdirectories in `shared` for common utilities, services, and models.
5. For each feature, create a new directory under `features/` with subdirectories for components, services, and models.
6. Place your main application entry point in the `main/` directory.
7. Set up your testing framework in the `tests/` directory.

## Implementation Steps for an Existing Project

1. Create a new branch for the restructuring.
2. Create the new folder structure alongside your existing structure.
3. Gradually move files into the new structure:
   - Identify shared resources and move them to `src/shared/`.
   - Group feature-specific code and move it to `src/features/[feature-name]/`.
   - Move the main application entry point to `src/main/`.
4. Update import statements in your code to reflect the new file locations.
5. Adjust your build configuration and scripts to work with the new structure.
6. Run your test suite and fix any broken tests.
7. Gradually update your CI/CD pipeline to work with the new structure.

## Best Practices

- Keep feature directories focused and avoid creating overly nested structures.
- Regularly review the `shared` directory to ensure it doesn't become a dumping ground for all code.
- Use clear, descriptive names for directories and files.
- Maintain consistency in how you structure each feature directory.
- Update documentation to reflect the new structure.

## Next Steps

- Review the full whitepaper for in-depth explanations and benefits of this structure.
- Consult the language-specific examples for guidance on implementing this structure in your preferred programming language.
- Refer to the architectural style adaptations for guidance on using this structure with different architectural patterns.

By following these steps and principles, you'll be well on your way to implementing a scalable, maintainable, and efficient folder structure for your project.
