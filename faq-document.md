# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This document addresses common questions and concerns about the standardized folder structure proposed in the white paper.

## General Questions

### Q1: Why should I adopt this standardized folder structure?
A1: The standardized folder structure offers several benefits:
- Improved code organization and readability
- Enhanced collaboration among team members
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Better scalability for growing projects
- Simplified maintenance and refactoring

### Q2: Is this structure suitable for all types of projects?
A2: While the structure is designed to be versatile, it may require some adaptation for specific project types or frameworks. The core principles can be applied to most software projects, but you should always consider your project's unique requirements.

### Q3: How does this structure compare to other popular architectures like MVC or Clean Architecture?
A3: This folder structure is not mutually exclusive with architectural patterns like MVC or Clean Architecture. It can be adapted to work alongside these patterns, providing a consistent organization scheme while still adhering to the principles of your chosen architecture.

## Implementation Questions

### Q4: How do I start implementing this structure in an existing project?
A4: Start by creating a migration plan:
1. Analyze your current structure
2. Identify shared resources and features
3. Create the new folder structure alongside the existing one
4. Gradually move files and update imports
5. Refactor and test as you go
For more detailed steps, refer to our Migration Guide.

### Q5: Will adopting this structure break my existing code?
A5: The structure itself won't break your code, but the process of reorganizing files may require updating import statements and possibly refactoring some components. Always thoroughly test your application after making structural changes.

### Q6: How do I handle framework-specific folders or files?
A6: Framework-specific folders or files can often be integrated into the standardized structure. For example, a `config/` folder could be placed at the root level, or framework-specific components could be organized within the `features/` directory.

## Feature-Centric Organization

### Q7: What if a piece of code is used by multiple features?
A7: If a component is used by multiple features, consider moving it to the `shared/` directory. This promotes reusability while maintaining a clear organization.

### Q8: How granular should features be?
A8: Features should be cohesive units of functionality. They shouldn't be so large that they become unwieldy, nor so small that you end up with an excessive number of tiny features. Use your judgment based on your project's specific needs.

## Scalability and Maintenance

### Q9: How does this structure support project scalability?
A9: The feature-centric organization and clear separation of shared resources make it easier to add new features or expand existing ones without affecting the entire codebase. This modularity supports scalability as your project grows.

### Q10: Will this structure help reduce technical debt?
A10: Yes, by promoting clear organization and separation of concerns, this structure can help reduce technical debt. It makes it easier to identify and refactor problematic areas, and encourages better code organization practices.

## Team Collaboration

### Q11: How can I convince my team to adopt this structure?
A11: Share the benefits outlined in the white paper, including improved collaboration, easier onboarding, and better maintainability. Consider implementing the structure in a small project or feature first to demonstrate its advantages.

### Q12: How does this structure impact code reviews?
A12: The standardized structure can make code reviews more efficient. Reviewers will have a consistent expectation of where to find certain types of code, making it easier to navigate and understand changes.

## Tools and Integration

### Q13: Are there any tools to help enforce this structure?
A13: While there aren't specific tools designed for this exact structure, many IDEs and linters can be configured to enforce certain folder and file naming conventions. Refer to our Tooling and IDE Integration Guide for more information.

### Q14: How does this structure work with monorepos?
A14: This structure can work well in a monorepo setup. Each project or package within the monorepo can follow this structure, promoting consistency across the entire repository.

## Performance and Efficiency

### Q15: Will this structure impact my application's performance?
A15: The folder structure itself doesn't directly impact runtime performance. However, by promoting better organization and modularity, it can lead to more efficient code that's easier to optimize.

### Q16: How does this structure affect build times?
A16: The impact on build times can vary depending on your specific setup. In some cases, the clear separation of concerns might allow for more efficient partial builds. However, you may need to adjust your build configuration to fully leverage the structure.

Remember, while this structure aims to solve many common organizational issues in software projects, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. Always consider your project's specific needs and be prepared to make thoughtful adaptations where necessary.
