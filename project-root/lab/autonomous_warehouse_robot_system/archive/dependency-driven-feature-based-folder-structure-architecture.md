The **strict feature-based, dependency-driven folder structure with modules and composition architecture** organizes code around discrete, self-contained **features** rather than technical layers (e.g., models, services, controllers). Each feature is treated as an autonomous module, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain each part of the system independently. This approach emphasizes **modularity** and **composition** by structuring dependencies so that each feature can operate autonomously, only relying on well-defined dependencies where necessary.

### **Key Principles**

1. **Feature-Based Organization**:
   * Each folder under features/ represents a **main feature** (a primary, independent functionality of the system).
   * A **main feature** contains all code needed for that specific functionality, organized by purpose (e.g., robots, sensors, tasks in a warehouse management system).
   * Each feature manages its dependencies and interactions, minimizing coupling with other features and promoting modularity.
2. **Dependency-Driven Structure**:
   * Dependencies between features are minimized, and each feature only depends on explicitly defined dependencies.
   * Dependency **injection** is preferred over hard-coded dependencies, allowing flexibility, substitutability, and reducing direct coupling.
3. **No Base Classes or Shared Inheritance**:
   * This architecture avoids using base classes, especially shared ones, to prevent tightly coupled inheritance chains.
   * Instead of inheritance, functionality is achieved through **composition**—features interact through interfaces, modules, and dependency injection, which allows for flexible combinations without hierarchical relationships.
4. **Modules Instead of Classes**:
   * Instead of encapsulating logic in classes (as in OOP), this architecture uses **modules** (individual files or scripts) to represent independent units of functionality within each feature.
   * Each module contains **pure functions** and specific logic for the feature it represents, allowing for simpler, stateless, and reusable components.

### **Folder Structure**

Below is an example of the folder structure for a **feature-based dependency-driven** architecture, using an Autonomous Warehouse Robot Control System as a case study.

### **Glossary**

* **Main Feature**: A direct child of the features/ folder, representing a core functionality (e.g., robots/, sensors/, tasks/, control/).
* **Sub-Module**: A file or folder within a main feature that provides specific functionality related to that feature (e.g., picking_robot.py within robots/).
* **Common Folder**: Holds non-feature-specific utilities or helpers, like logging or configuration loading, that do not belong to any specific feature.
* **Shared Folder**: Each main feature can have a shared subdirectory for helper functions or utilities used across that feature’s modules but not outside the feature. This isolates dependencies within each feature.

### **Sharing Code and Dependencies**

1. **Common Folder for Non-Feature Shared Code**:
   * The common/ folder contains code that is used globally across all features (e.g., logging, configuration loading).
2. **Feature-Specific Shared Folders**:
   * For dependencies specific to a feature, each feature can have its own shared/ folder. For example, robots/shared/robot_utils.py contains utilities relevant to robots but not to other features.
3. **Intermediate Shared Folders for Lower-Level Modules**:
   * If a sub-module within a main feature (e.g., picking_robot.py) requires shared functions or utilities specific to its subdomain, an intermediate shared folder can be created to organize these dependencies effectively.
4. **Interface-Driven Sharing for Main Features**:
   * Main features can interact through explicitly defined interfaces in features/shared. This avoids direct dependencies, allowing flexibility and maintaining modular independence.

### **Benefits of This Architecture**

1. **Decoupled Modularity**:
   * By treating each feature as an independent module, dependencies are minimized and interactions are controlled via injected interfaces or shared utilities, supporting modular autonomy.
2. **Easier Composition and Testing**:
   * Each feature can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, as there’s no tight coupling through inheritance or shared classes.
3. **Reduced Complexity and Cognitive Load**:
   * Modules are self-contained with clearly defined purposes, reducing the mental overhead for developers by localizing responsibilities and dependencies within each feature.
4. **High Extensibility**:
   * Adding a new feature (e.g., a new robot type or task) involves creating a new module in the appropriate feature directory without modifying the existing code, thereby avoiding regressions.
5. **Event-Driven Independence**:
   * For cross-feature interactions, modules can use lightweight event handling to communicate without relying on a centralized controller, further reinforcing the independence of each feature.
6. **Avoids Over-Engineering**:
   * Unlike OOP, where design patterns and inheritance hierarchies can add complexity, this structure emphasizes simplicity and composition, making it particularly suitable for applications where modularity and simplicity are prioritized over complex interdependencies.

This **strict feature-based dependency-driven structure** demonstrates how modular independence and code simplicity can be achieved without the overhead and tightly coupled relationships often associated with OOP. Each feature operates independently, only interacting with others through clearly defined, dependency-injected interfaces or minimal shared utilities, making the system easier to scale, test, and maintain.
