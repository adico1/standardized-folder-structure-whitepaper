To create both an **OOP architecture** and a **strict feature-based dependency-driven folder structure with modules and composition** for the **Autonomous Warehouse Robot Control System**, we’ll use the same set of requirements:

### **Shared System Requirements**

1. **Central Control Unit (CCU)**: Manages all robots, assigns tasks, and monitors system status.
2. **Robots**:
   * Robots perform specific actions such as picking items, sorting, and inspecting.
   * Types include PickingRobot, SortingRobot, and InspectionRobot.
3. **Sensors**:
   * Sensors provide real-time data to assist robots, including ProximitySensor, WeightSensor, and CameraSensor.
4. **Tasks**:
   * Tasks define robot actions, including PickItemTask, SortItemTask, and AvoidObstacleTask.
5. **Safety Protocols**:
   * Modules to handle safety, including error logging, state management, and emergency protocols.

The goal is to represent both architectures with the same components, structured in their respective approaches.

## **1\. OOP Architecture Folder Structure**

This structure uses inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and design patterns like Singleton and Observer.

### **Explanation of Key Files**

* **controllers/**: Manages system operations, robot actions, task assignments, and safety protocols.
* **robots/**: Inherits the base Robot class, with subclasses for each robot type.
* **sensors/**: Inherits the base Sensor class, enabling polymorphic behavior.
* **tasks/**: Uses inheritance from Task to manage task types with a shared interface.
* **safety/**: Manages state, logs activities, and handles emergencies.
* **utilities/**: Provides common functions and patterns, such as Singleton and Observer.

## **2\. Strict Feature-Based Dependency-Driven Folder Structure with Modules and Composition**

This structure organizes code by feature, with minimal interdependencies between main features. We use shared folders for code reuse according to the rules provided.

```

### **Explanation of Key Files**

* **common/**: Provides shared code that is not feature-specific, like configuration loading and logging, which can be used across main features.
* **features/control/**: Manages robot coordination, task assignment, and safety protocols. Contains the control_center.py for overall system operations and safety_handler.py for handling emergency situations.
* **features/robots/**:
  * **shared/robot\_interface.py**: Defines a robot interface that each robot type implements.
  * **Sub-modules** (picking_robot, sorting_robot, inspection_robot): Each robot type is isolated within its sub-module, allowing easy expansion or modification without affecting other robot types.
* **features/sensors/**:
  * **shared/sensor\_interface.py**: Provides a shared interface for sensors, ensuring consistency.
  * **Sub-modules** (proximity_sensor, weight_sensor, camera_sensor): Each sensor type is implemented as a standalone sub-module, which reduces dependencies and supports future extension.
* **features/tasks/**:
  * **shared/task\_interface.py**: Provides an interface for task management.
  * **Sub-modules** (pick_item_task, sort_item_task, avoid_obstacle_task): Each task type is a separate module, allowing isolated task implementation with minimal dependencies.
* **features/state\_management/**:
  * Contains emergency_handler.py to handle system state changes, error tracking, and emergency protocols, which centralizes safety management for the system.

### **Summary**

This setup provides a clear contrast between the two approaches:

* **OOP Architecture** relies on inheritance and design patterns to manage complexity, modularity, and adaptability.
* **Feature-Based Dependency-Driven Structure** focuses on feature isolation, modular composition, and dependency injection, promoting flexibility and minimal dependencies among modules.

Both structures meet the same set of requirements but showcase different architectural strengths, enabling benchmarking for modularity, maintainability, and performance in complex systems.
