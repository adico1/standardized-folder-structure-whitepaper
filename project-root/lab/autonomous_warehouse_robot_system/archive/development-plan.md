step-by-step development plan for both the **OOP architecture** and the **feature-based dependency-driven architecture** of the **Autonomous Warehouse Robot Control System** lab application. This plan will ensure each architecture meets the same requirements, facilitating a direct comparison.

---

## **Phase 1: Initial Setup and Configuration Management**

### **1.1 Create Project Structure**

* Set up the initial folder structure for both architectures:
  * **OOP Architecture**: Organize with folders for `controllers`, `robots`, `sensors`, `tasks`, `safety`, and `utilities`.
  * **Feature-Based Architecture**: Organize with `features` folder containing subfolders for each main feature (e.g., `robots`, `sensors`, `tasks`, `state_management`) and `common` for shared modules.

### **1.2 Implement Configuration Loader**

* **Both Architectures**: Develop `config_loader.py` in `utilities` (for OOP) and `common` (for feature-based) to load configuration files:
  * **Initial Load**: Implement functions to load `robot_config.json`, `sensor_config.json`, and `task_config.json`.
  * **Dynamic Updates**: Add functionality to reload configurations on-demand or update individual configurations dynamically.
* **Testing**: Test loading and dynamic updating of configuration values to ensure itâ€™s reliable and works for both architectures.

### **1.3 Define Configuration Files**

* Create and populate `robot_config.json`, `sensor_config.json`, and `task_config.json` with settings for robot attributes, sensor parameters, and task definitions.
* **Validation**: Validate configurations to ensure they meet the specifications for each type of robot, sensor, and task.

## **Phase 2: Core Component Development**

### **2.1 Develop the Central Control Unit (CCU)**

* **OOP Architecture**:
  * Create `CentralControlUnit` class in the `controllers` folder.
  * Implement Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of the CCU exists.
  * The CCU will use the `ConfigLoader` to retrieve settings dynamically and manage task assignment and robot coordination.
* **Feature-Based Architecture**:
  * Develop `control_center.py` module in `features/control`.
  * Import configuration settings from `config_loader` for task priorities and safety thresholds.
  * Implement as a function-based module to assign tasks, manage robot coordination, and respond to state changes without relying on a Singleton.

### **2.2 Develop Robot Components**

* **OOP Architecture**:
  * Define a base `Robot` class in the `robots` folder.
  * Create subclasses: `PickingRobot`, `SortingRobot`, and `InspectionRobot`, each inheriting from `Robot` and accessing configuration settings specific to their role (e.g., `max_speed`, `battery_capacity`).
  * Implement methods to execute tasks and interact with sensors dynamically.
* **Feature-Based Architecture**:
  * In `features/robots`, create individual modules for each robot type (`picking_robot.py`, `sorting_robot.py`, `inspection_robot.py`).
  * Each module will access robot-specific configurations directly from `config_loader`, and implement functions for tasks (e.g., `perform_pick_task()`, `perform_sort_task()`).
  * Use a `shared/robot_interface.py` file to define a common interface for all robot modules if needed.

### **2.3 Develop Sensor Components**

* **OOP Architecture**:
  * Define a base `Sensor` class in the `sensors` folder with subclasses `ProximitySensor`, `WeightSensor`, and `CameraSensor`.
  * Each sensor subclass should implement methods to simulate data readings and access relevant configurations (e.g., operational range, sensitivity).
  * Implement dynamic configuration adaptation so sensors can react to real-time configuration changes.
* **Feature-Based Architecture**:
  * In `features/sensors`, create individual sensor modules (`proximity_sensor.py`, `weight_sensor.py`, `camera_sensor.py`).
  * Each module will independently call `config_loader` to retrieve its configuration, defining functions to simulate data readings.
  * Create a `shared/sensor_interface.py` to define common sensor functions if needed.

### **2.4 Develop Task Components**

* **OOP Architecture**:
  * Define a base `Task` class in the `tasks` folder with subclasses `PickItemTask`, `SortItemTask`, and `AvoidObstacleTask`.
  * Implement task-specific methods in each subclass, ensuring they retrieve priorities and timeouts dynamically.
  * Tasks will be assigned to robots via the `CentralControlUnit`.
* **Feature-Based Architecture**:
  * In `features/tasks`, create individual task modules (`pick_item_task.py`, `sort_item_task.py`, `avoid_obstacle_task.py`).
  * Each task module will access `task_config.json` through `config_loader` to retrieve settings like `priority` and `timeout`, allowing for flexible, independent task execution.
  * Use `shared/task_interface.py` for any shared task functions, ensuring consistency across modules.

### **2.5 Develop Safety Protocols**

* **OOP Architecture**:
  * Implement `SafetyController` in `controllers/safety_controller.py` to manage state changes, log errors, and respond to emergencies.
  * Use the Observer pattern to track state changes across components and ensure they adapt dynamically based on configurations.
* **Feature-Based Architecture**:
  * In `features/state_management`, create `emergency_handler.py` to manage system state, safety protocols, and emergency events.
  * Access configuration values for emergency stop thresholds and logging intervals via `config_loader`.

---

## **Phase 3: Integration and Dynamic Configuration Testing**

### **3.1 Integrate Components**

* **OOP Architecture**:
  * Initialize and integrate all components in `main.py`, using `CentralControlUnit` to coordinate robots, assign tasks, and handle sensors.
  * Ensure `SafetyController` is observing component states and applying emergency protocols as necessary.
* **Feature-Based Architecture**:
  * Use `control_center.py` in `features/control` as the main coordinator, orchestrating tasks and monitoring robot states.
  * Integrate all feature modules in `main.py`, ensuring that each module accesses configurations independently and autonomously from `config_loader`.

### **3.2 Dynamic Configuration Testing**

* Test dynamic configuration updates by modifying settings in `robot_config.json`, `sensor_config.json`, and `task_config.json` while the application is running.
* Ensure each architecture can adapt to configuration changes without restarting:
  * **OOP**: Verify that `ConfigLoader` and controllers dynamically propagate updates across components.
  * **Feature-Based**: Confirm that modules retrieve up-to-date settings directly from `config_loader`, allowing real-time adaptability.

### **3.3 Performance Testing and Benchmarking**

* Measure modularity, maintainability, and adaptability in both architectures by:
  * Adding new robot, sensor, and task types and measuring the time and effort required.
  * Modifying configuration files frequently to observe how each system adapts.
  * Logging performance metrics to assess efficiency in real-time adaptation and modular independence.

## **Summary of Development Phases**

| Phase | Tasks for OOP Architecture | Tasks for Feature-Based Architecture |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1\. Initial Setup** | Create folders, implement `ConfigLoader` in `utilities` | Create folders, implement `config_loader.py` in `common` |
| **2\. Core Development** | Develop controllers, classes for robots, sensors, tasks, and safety | Develop modules for robots, sensors, tasks, and safety protocols |
| **3\. Integration & Testing** | Integrate components in `main.py`, test dynamic configurations | Integrate features in `main.py`, test dynamic configurations |

This plan ensures both architectures adhere to the same requirements, facilitating a structured, comparable development process to benchmark the strengths and weaknesses of each approach effectively.
