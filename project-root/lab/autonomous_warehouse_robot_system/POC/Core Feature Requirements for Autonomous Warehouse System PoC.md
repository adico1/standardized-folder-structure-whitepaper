## **Core Feature Requirements for Autonomous Warehouse System PoC**

### **1\. Navigation**

* **Objective: Enable robots to autonomously navigate warehouse aisles, avoiding obstacles and following paths to specific locations as assigned by the task manager.**
* **Primary Responsibilities:**
  * **Pathfinding: Calculate the most efficient route to a target location, taking into account the warehouse layout.**
  * **Movement Control: Manage movement based on coordinates provided by the task manager, ensuring accuracy and responsiveness.**
  * **Obstacle Avoidance: Dynamically reroute or pause movement if an obstacle is detected on the path.**
* **Dependencies:**
  * **Obstacle Detection: Real-time data from obstacle detection sensors is required to prevent collisions.**
  * **Task Assignment: Navigation coordinates are received from the task assignment feature to guide robots to the correct destinations.**
  * **Communication: The current position and status of navigation (e.g., en route, rerouting, arrived) should be communicated back to the central task manager.**

### **2\. Task Assignment**

* **Objective: Efficiently manage and assign tasks to available robots based on their status, position, and task priority.**
* **Primary Responsibilities:**
  * **Task Prioritization: Handle multiple tasks in the queue, assigning them based on priority, robot availability, and proximity to the task location.**
  * **Dynamic Assignment: Reassign tasks if a robot encounters an obstacle, is delayed, or completes a task, ensuring smooth workflow across the warehouse.**
  * **Task Lifecycle Management: Track the progress of each task (e.g., assigned, in-progress, completed) and update status as tasks advance.**
* **Dependencies:**
  * **Navigation: Track robot locations and assign tasks based on proximity to task locations.**
  * **Communication: Use communication channels to distribute tasks to robots and receive updates on task progress.**
  * **Obstacle Detection: Receive notifications if an obstacle prevents a robot from completing a task, allowing for reassignment if needed.**

### **3\. Obstacle Detection**

* **Objective: Ensure safe navigation by detecting obstacles in real-time to avoid collisions.**
* **Primary Responsibilities:**
  * **Sensor Monitoring: Continuously scan the robotâ€™s environment for obstacles using sensors such as infrared or ultrasonic.**
  * **Obstacle Alerts: Immediately notify the navigation feature when an obstacle is detected in the robot's path.**
  * **Status Updates: Report clear paths to the task manager to facilitate smooth task flow.**
* **Dependencies:**
  * **Navigation: Provide real-time obstacle detection data to navigation to guide safe pathfinding.**
  * **Task Assignment: Inform task assignment when a detected obstacle affects task completion, triggering potential reassignment.**
  * **Communication: Broadcast updates on obstacle detection status, particularly when changes occur (e.g., obstacle cleared).**

### **4\. Communication**

* **Objective: Manage centralized and continuous communication for updates on robot status, task progress, and inter-feature notifications.**
* **Primary Responsibilities:**
  * **Robot-Task Manager Communication: Facilitate the sending and receiving of task instructions, completion notifications, and status updates between the central task manager and each robot.**
  * **Event Broadcasting: Distribute real-time events, such as obstacle detection, task completion, and robot status changes, to relevant modules (navigation, task assignment).**
  * **Error Handling Notifications: Relay error messages or critical alerts (e.g., navigation issues, unresponsive robot) back to the central system or task manager.**
* **Dependencies:**
  * **All Other Features: Act as an intermediary by receiving and broadcasting updates across features.**
  * **Event Dispatcher (for FIMC): Coordinate event-based updates in FIMC, ensuring each module receives real-time information to maintain system responsiveness.**

### **Implementation Notes for Each Feature**

1. **Navigation should be flexible to work with dynamic inputs from `Obstacle Detection`, adjusting paths as new data is received in real-time.**
2. **Task Assignment requires an efficient queuing system to handle task priority and must dynamically reassess and reassign tasks if obstacles or delays are encountered.**
3. **Obstacle Detection must operate on a continuous scan cycle to ensure real-time data is available to the `Navigation` module, with quick response to obstacles for safety and efficiency.**
4. **Communication is central to coordinating actions between features, especially for FIMC where dependency injection and event-driven updates need a robust dispatch system.**

**This document outlines the primary functionality of each feature and highlights how dependencies and interactions are managed in the autonomous warehouse system. It should serve as a foundation for implementing the PoC in both OOP and FIMC architectures, ensuring a balanced approach in the code generation.**
