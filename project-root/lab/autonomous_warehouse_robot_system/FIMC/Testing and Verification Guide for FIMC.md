# **Testing and Verification Guide for FIMC**

**Purpose: This document provides guidelines and best practices for testing and verifying systems built using the Feature-based, Dependency-driven Folder Structure with Modules and Composition (FIMC) architecture. The goal is to ensure that FIMC’s modularity, autonomy, and flexibility are fully leveraged and that each module and feature can be independently tested and verified.**

### **1\. Unit and Integration Testing in FIMC**

#### **Unit Testing for Self-Contained Modules**

* **Goal: Verify each module’s functionality in isolation to ensure that individual components work as expected without relying on external systems or modules.**
* **Methodology:**
  * **Feature Isolation: Each feature (e.g., `robots`, `sensors`, `tasks`) is a self-contained module. Unit tests should focus on testing the core functionality of each module independently. For instance, if testing a module `picking_robot.py`, validate only the picking robot's specific functions, not how it interacts with other robots or the central control.**
  * **Pure Functions: Since FIMC emphasizes pure functions, these functions should be individually tested to confirm consistent outputs for given inputs, reducing the risk of hidden side effects.**
* **Example:**
  * **Test the `picking_robot.py` module by verifying that the picking function identifies and picks up items correctly when given specific item IDs.**

#### **Integration Testing for Modular Independence**

* **Goal: Verify interactions between multiple modules within a single feature or across features, ensuring that modules work together as expected.**
* **Methodology:**
  * **Feature-Level Testing: Integration tests should combine modules within a single feature (e.g., different sensors within the `sensors` feature) to test interdependencies.**
  * **Cross-Feature Testing: When necessary, combine modules from different features (e.g., a `control_center.py` module from `control` and a `picking_robot.py` module from `robots`) to ensure modular autonomy while confirming that dependencies are injected correctly and modules remain decoupled.**
* **Example:**
  * **In a warehouse management scenario, test how `control_center.py` in `control` assigns tasks to `picking_robot.py` in `robots`, verifying that both modules work independently and communicate effectively when integrated.**

### **2\. Mocking and Dependency Injection**

**FIMC heavily relies on dependency injection to manage modular autonomy and flexibility. To effectively test modules without involving actual dependencies, mocking is essential.**

#### **Mocking Dependencies**

* **Goal: Substitute actual dependencies with mock versions to isolate testing, ensuring that each module functions independently of external systems.**
* **Methodology:**
  * **Mock Functions and Data: Use mock functions or data to simulate dependencies. For example, mock a `get_item_location` function that returns a pre-defined location without accessing a real database.**
  * **Mock Events: For modules that depend on event-driven inputs, use mock events to simulate various scenarios and verify that the module responds appropriately.**
* **Example:**
  * **Mock a `proximity_sensor` module in the `picking_robot.py` to simulate an obstacle detection event without relying on an actual physical sensor, allowing you to test the robot’s reaction in isolation.**

#### **Testing with Dependency Injection**

* **Goal: Inject dependencies into modules during testing to verify that modules work as expected under different configurations or environmental conditions.**
* **Methodology:**
  * **Environment-Specific Dependencies: Inject different configurations for production, staging, and testing environments to verify that the module adapts as expected.**
  * **Flexible Dependency Injection: For example, inject either a mock database or a live database connector depending on the testing context.**
* **Example:**
  * **In a `task` module, inject different configurations for task types (e.g., `PickItemTask`, `AvoidObstacleTask`) and test how the module adapts without changing the core code structure.**

### **3\. Real-Time and Event-Driven Testing**

**FIMC often uses event-driven communication for real-time interactions between modules, allowing autonomous modules to interact without central controllers. Real-time and event-driven testing ensures that these interactions work as expected in FIMC’s modular, decentralized setup.**

#### **Real-Time Interaction Testing**

* **Goal: Verify that modules respond accurately and within acceptable timing constraints to real-time events, ensuring responsive interactions.**
* **Methodology:**
  * **Simulated Events: Generate simulated events that mimic real-world interactions (e.g., sensor data updates, task completion events).**
  * **Asynchronous Testing: If applicable, use asynchronous testing tools to validate that modules can handle concurrent events without performance degradation.**
* **Example:**
  * **In a `sensors` feature, simulate rapid consecutive proximity sensor alerts and confirm that the `picking_robot.py` module responds appropriately within expected timing constraints.**

#### **Event-Driven Communication Testing**

* **Goal: Confirm that modules communicate effectively and respond correctly to events published by other modules without central control.**
* **Methodology:**
  * **Publish-Subscribe Testing: If using a publish-subscribe model for events, verify that subscribers correctly process events sent by publishers. For instance, test that `control_center.py` publishes a task completion event that all robots can listen to and react to appropriately.**
  * **Event Sequence Verification: Test event sequence integrity, ensuring that events are processed in the correct order and that all subscribers are notified.**
* **Example:**
  * **In a `control` feature, verify that the `control_center.py` module publishes task assignment events that the `picking_robot.py` module receives and processes as expected.**

### **4\. Testing Examples and Scenarios**

**The following examples provide concrete test scenarios for FIMC, showcasing how modular testability compares favorably with a traditional OOP structure:**

#### **Example 1: Testing a Task Module with Dependency Injection and Mocking**

* **FIMC Approach:**
  * **In FIMC, the `pick_item_task.py` module in `tasks` is tested by injecting a mock `item_database` dependency that returns predefined items and locations. Using this mock, validate that `pick_item_task.py` correctly locates and picks items without a real database.**
* **OOP Comparison:**
  * **In an OOP structure, testing a `PickItemTask` class might involve subclassing or setting up mock data within the class itself, which could introduce coupling and complexity. FIMC’s approach with dependency injection and standalone modules keeps the module testable without modifying internal logic.**

#### **Example 2: Real-Time Testing of Sensor and Robot Interaction**

* **FIMC Approach:**
  * **Test a real-time interaction where a `proximity_sensor.py` module in `sensors` detects an obstacle and sends an event to `picking_robot.py` in `robots`. Using asynchronous event simulation, confirm that `picking_robot.py` halts movement and logs the obstacle detection.**
* **OOP Comparison:**
  * **In an OOP setup, the `PickingRobot` class would likely have direct references to sensor classes or a central controller. Testing would require setting up instances of all related classes, whereas FIMC’s modular approach allows each sensor and robot module to remain independent.**

#### **Example 3: Integration Testing Across Features**

* **FIMC Approach:**
  * **Conduct an integration test involving `control_center.py` in `control` assigning tasks to `picking_robot.py` in `robots`. Inject mock configurations for task types and simulate a control command, confirming that both modules execute their responsibilities autonomously without direct coupling.**
* **OOP Comparison:**
  * **In an OOP architecture, testing might involve a central control class managing `PickingRobot` and task classes, requiring tight coupling to simulate the same interaction. FIMC’s approach with modular autonomy allows for integration without tightly bound dependencies.**
