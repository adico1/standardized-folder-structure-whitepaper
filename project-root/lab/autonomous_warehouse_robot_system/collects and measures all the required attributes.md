The plan collects and measures the required attributes of **OOP** and **feature-based dependency-driven architectures** through specific **benchmarking metrics** and **comparison points** designed for each development phase. Here’s a detailed explanation of how each attribute is measured, allowing for a robust, objective assessment:

### **1\. Modularity and Extensibility**

* **Measurement Goal**: To assess how easily each architecture supports adding new components and maintaining modular boundaries.
* **Approach**:
  * In **Phase 4** (Extensibility and Cognitive Load Evaluation), new components are added—like `ScanningRobot`, `TemperatureSensor`, and `InspectItemTask`—to both architectures.
  * **Metrics**: The time taken to add these components (implementation time) is recorded as the primary metric, reflecting how modular and extensible each structure is.
* **Why It’s Effective**: OOP’s reliance on inheritance and shared interfaces is expected to facilitate extensions with minimal code changes, while the feature-based approach’s modularity should allow isolated additions. The implementation time directly reflects how modular and scalable each approach is, allowing for a clear comparison.

### **2\. Code Reusability and Maintenance**

* **Measurement Goal**: To analyze each architecture’s ability to minimize code duplication and simplify maintenance, particularly when adding similar features.
* **Approach**:
  * In **Phase 4**, the extensibility tests also measure code reusability. For example, adding a new `Robot` subclass in OOP leverages inheritance, while in the feature-based approach, each new robot type is an independent module.
  * **Metrics**: Code duplication (observed by LOC across similar modules) and implementation time reflect reusability. In OOP, inheritance should theoretically reduce duplication, while feature-based modules might repeat code if they lack a shared base.
* **Why It’s Effective**: OOP’s inheritance and polymorphism are expected to reduce redundancy, while feature-based modules may duplicate logic. Tracking LOC and implementation time provides concrete insights into reusability and ease of maintenance.

### **3\. Real-Time Performance**

* **Measurement Goal**: To evaluate how each architecture handles real-time interactions and dynamic task allocation.
* **Approach**:
  * **Phase 2** introduces basic in-module event handling for essential interactions, such as task assignment and completion.
  * **Metrics**: Real-time responsiveness is observed by measuring the delay in event handling times during tasks. Direct interactions in OOP (via polymorphic interfaces) and in-module handling in the feature-based approach (without central controllers) are compared.
* **Why It’s Effective**: Polymorphism in OOP allows flexible interactions, ideal for real-time responses, while the feature-based setup may need more direct, in-module interactions. By measuring event-handling efficiency, we see which architecture manages real-time tasks more flexibly and responsively.

### **4\. Safety and Error Handling**

* **Measurement Goal**: To assess each architecture’s robustness under failure conditions and effectiveness in maintaining system safety.
* **Approach**:
  * In **Phase 3**, error handling is embedded within each module using a standardized template (e.g., retries, basic logging) for both architectures.
  * **Metrics**: Error resilience is measured by simulating errors (e.g., sensor failure or task malfunction) and recording recovery times. OOP’s centralized error management in `SafetyController` (as a coordinated approach) is contrasted with the feature-based approach’s isolated handling.
* **Why It’s Effective**: Design patterns in OOP are expected to support centralized control, making it well-suited for coordinated safety protocols. Measuring recovery times for both architectures shows how effectively each structure maintains reliability under error conditions, highlighting strengths in safety management.

### **5\. System Complexity and Developer Productivity (Cognitive Load)**

* **Measurement Goal**: To evaluate the cognitive load associated with extending and maintaining each architecture, reflecting developer productivity.
* **Approach**:
  * In **Phase 4**, the primary cognitive load metric is **implementation time** when adding new components. This metric reflects the ease of understanding, modifying, and adding features in each architecture.
  * **Metrics**: Implementation time alone is used to assess cognitive load, directly correlating with developer productivity and complexity.
* **Why It’s Effective**: OOP’s structured hierarchies may simplify cognitive load by centralizing logic but can introduce complexity through inheritance hierarchies. In contrast, the feature-based approach provides isolated modules, which may reduce dependencies but increase mental load in managing independent components. Measuring time to implement objectively assesses which architecture is simpler and less mentally taxing.

### **6\. Scalability through Inheritance vs. Composition**

* **Measurement Goal**: To determine how each architecture’s approach to scalability (inheritance vs. composition) supports or complicates growth.
* **Approach**:
  * **Phase 1** and **Phase 4** both contribute to measuring scalability. Phase 1 sets up core components using OOP’s inheritance for shared logic, while the feature-based structure avoids inheritance in favor of modular composition. Phase 4’s extensibility tests show how well each architecture scales with new components.
  * **Metrics**: LOC and implementation time reflect scalability. For OOP, new classes extending existing hierarchies demonstrate inheritance benefits, while feature-based modules show the flexibility and modularity of composition.
* **Why It’s Effective**: Inheritance is suited for scalable extensions without modifying existing code, while the feature-based approach uses composition, prioritizing isolated modules. Measuring implementation time and LOC clarifies each architecture’s approach to scalability, highlighting where inheritance or composition is more effective.

### **Summary of Attribute Measurement in the Plan**

| Attribute | Measurement Method | Expected Insight |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |

| **Code Reusability & Maintenance** | LOC and implementation time when extending functionality | Shows how well each approach manages duplication and maintenance |
| **Real-Time Performance** | Event-handling delay in essential interactions (Phase 2\) | Highlights responsiveness in real-time task handling |
| **Safety & Error Handling** | Recovery times during error simulations (Phase 3\) | Assesses resilience and centralized safety management (OOP) |
| **Cognitive Load** | Implementation time (primary metric in Phase 4\) | Evaluates ease of use and developer productivity |
| **Scalability (Inheritance vs. Composition)** | LOC and implementation time for adding new features | Compares flexibility of scaling with inheritance vs. composition |

### **Conclusion**

The plan effectively collects metrics across each phase to objectively measure **OOP’s strengths** in **complexity management, modularity, reusability, and safety** against the feature-based structure’s strengths in **modularity, independence, and cognitive simplicity**. Each attribute is benchmarked with practical, quantifiable metrics, making the comparison between the two architectures both fair and directly aligned with the thesis.
