# AI Integration Examples

This document provides code samples and tutorials demonstrating how AI tools can be integrated with projects using the standardized folder structure. These examples showcase how AI can enhance development workflows, improve code quality, and automate certain tasks within the proposed structure.

## 1. AI-Assisted Code Generation

This example demonstrates how to use OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate boilerplate code for new features.

```python
# src/shared/utils/ai_code_generator.py

import openai

class AICodeGenerator:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        openai.api_key = api_key

    def generate_feature_boilerplate(self, feature_name, description):
        prompt = f"""
        Create a boilerplate for a new feature named '{feature_name}' with the following description:
        {description}

        The code should follow this structure:
        - src/features/{feature_name}/
          - __init__.py
          - models.py
          - services.py
          - controllers.py

        Provide the content for each file.
        """

        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="text-davinci-002",
            prompt=prompt,
            max_tokens=500,
            n=1,
            stop=None,
            temperature=0.7,
        )

        return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Usage example
generator = AICodeGenerator("your-api-key")
boilerplate = generator.generate_feature_boilerplate(
    "user_authentication",
    "Implement user registration, login, and password reset functionality."
)
print(boilerplate)
```

This utility can be used to quickly scaffold new features while adhering to the standardized folder structure.

## 2. AI-Powered Code Review

This example shows how to integrate an AI-powered code review tool into your CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ai-code-review.yml

name: AI Code Review

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  ai-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: AI Code Review
      uses: coderabbitai/ai-pr-reviewer@v1
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

This workflow will automatically trigger an AI-powered code review on each pull request, providing suggestions and identifying potential issues.

## 3. AI-Assisted Documentation Generation

This example demonstrates how to use AI to generate documentation for your project structure.

```python
# src/shared/utils/ai_doc_generator.py

import openai
import os

class AIDocGenerator:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        openai.api_key = api_key

    def generate_structure_documentation(self, root_dir):
        structure = self._get_directory_structure(root_dir)
        prompt = f"""
        Generate documentation for the following project structure:

        {structure}

        Explain the purpose of each main directory and how it fits into the overall architecture.
        """

        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="text-davinci-002",
            prompt=prompt,
            max_tokens=500,
            n=1,
            stop=None,
            temperature=0.7,
        )

        return response.choices[0].text.strip()

    def _get_directory_structure(self, root_dir):
        structure = []
        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(root_dir):
            level = root.replace(root_dir, '').count(os.sep)
            indent = ' ' * 4 * level
            structure.append(f'{indent}{os.path.basename(root)}/')
            sub_indent = ' ' * 4 * (level + 1)
            for file in files:
                structure.append(f'{sub_indent}{file}')
        return '\n'.join(structure)

# Usage example
generator = AIDocGenerator("your-api-key")
documentation = generator.generate_structure_documentation("path/to/your/project")
print(documentation)
```

This utility can help maintain up-to-date documentation of your project structure, especially useful for onboarding new team members.

## 4. AI-Powered Code Refactoring Suggestions

This example shows how to use AI to suggest refactoring opportunities based on the standardized folder structure.

```python
# src/shared/utils/ai_refactor_suggester.py

import openai
import os

class AIRefactorSuggester:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        openai.api_key = api_key

    def suggest_refactoring(self, file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            code = file.read()

        prompt = f"""
        Analyze the following code and suggest refactoring opportunities to better align with a standardized folder structure:

        {code}

        Consider:
        1. Moving shared functionality to src/shared/
        2. Organizing feature-specific code in src/features/
        3. Improving separation of concerns
        4. Enhancing code reusability

        Provide specific suggestions with code examples.
        """

        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="text-davinci-002",
            prompt=prompt,
            max_tokens=500,
            n=1,
            stop=None,
            temperature=0.7,
        )

        return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Usage example
suggester = AIRefactorSuggester("your-api-key")
suggestions = suggester.suggest_refactoring("path/to/your/file.py")
print(suggestions)
```

This tool can help identify areas where code can be better organized according to the standardized folder structure.

## Conclusion

These examples demonstrate how AI can be leveraged to enhance development workflows within the standardized folder structure. By integrating AI tools, teams can automate routine tasks, improve code quality, and maintain better documentation, all while adhering to the proposed organizational principles.

Remember to handle API keys securely and respect usage limits and costs associated with AI services. As AI technologies evolve, more sophisticated integrations may become possible, further enhancing the benefits of the standardized folder structure.
