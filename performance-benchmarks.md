# Performance Benchmarks: A Proposal for Future Research

This document outlines a proposal for conducting empirical research to compare projects using the proposed standardized folder structure against those using traditional structures. As of now, we do not have concrete empirical evidence, but this framework will guide future studies to gather meaningful data.

## Proposed Methodology

We suggest a comparative study involving multiple software development teams across various industries. The study should be conducted over a significant period (e.g., 12-24 months) to capture long-term effects.

1. **Sample Selection**:
   - Recruit a diverse set of development teams (varying in size, industry, and experience)
   - Ensure a mix of greenfield projects and existing projects transitioning to the new structure

2. **Control and Experimental Groups**:
   - Control Group: Teams using their traditional folder structures
   - Experimental Group: Teams adopting the proposed standardized folder structure

3. **Data Collection**:
   Collect data on the following metrics:

   - Development speed (time to add features, fix bugs)
   - Code quality (cyclomatic complexity, code duplication, test coverage)
   - Team productivity (story points completed, deployment frequency)
   - Maintainability (time spent refactoring, technical debt accumulation)
   - Scalability (time to onboard new team members, ease of adding new services)

4. **Qualitative Analysis**:
   - Regular surveys and interviews with team members to gather insights on usability and satisfaction

## Potential Metrics to Measure

1. **Development Speed**:
   - Time to add new features
   - Time to fix bugs
   - Onboarding time for new developers

2. **Maintainability**:
   - Cyclomatic complexity
   - Code duplication percentage
   - Test coverage

3. **Scalability**:
   - Time to scale team size
   - Time to add new microservices or major features
   - Deployment frequency

4. **Long-term Project Health**:
   - Technical debt (measured in story points or time)
   - Time spent refactoring
   - Customer-reported bugs

## Expected Outcomes

While we cannot predict exact numbers without conducting the study, based on theoretical benefits of the proposed structure, we might expect to see improvements in:

- Reduced time for adding new features and fixing bugs
- Decreased code duplication and improved test coverage
- Faster onboarding of new team members
- Improved ability to scale the project and team size
- Reduced accumulation of technical debt over time

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Controlling Variables**: Ensure that other factors (team skill, project complexity) are accounted for in the analysis.
2. **Long-term Commitment**: The study requires significant time investment from participating teams.
3. **Learning Curve**: Account for the initial learning period when teams adopt the new structure.
4. **Diverse Application**: Ensure the study covers various project types and tech stacks for broader applicability.

## Conclusion

This benchmarking proposal sets the foundation for gathering empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the proposed standardized folder structure. By following this methodology, we aim to provide concrete data to support or refine our approach, ultimately contributing to improved software development practices across the industry.

We encourage researchers and organizations to collaborate on this study, as the results will be valuable for the entire software development community.
